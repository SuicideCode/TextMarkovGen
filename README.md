# TextMarkovGen
This Java application is for text generation using Markov chains. The application generates a new text that stylistically imitates a given input text by analysing the input's character occurrence. The underlying concept is the Infinite Monkey Theorem, which suggests that a monkey hitting keys arbitrarily on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time can almost surely produce a chosen text. Automated text generation is an intriguing and useful application of this theory.

The program takes three command line arguments: a non-negative integer k, another non-negative integer length, and an input file that contains more than k characters. The application validates the command line arguments by making sure that k and length are non-negative and that the input file can be opened for reading.
